## 💰 Full Guide: P/L Calculation with Leverage

### (Longs, Shorts, Fees & Funding)

---

### **1️⃣ General Concepts**

| Term              | Meaning                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Entry Price**   | Price where you open the position          |
| **Exit Price**    | Price where you close it                   |
| **Leverage (L)**  | Multiplier of exposure vs. your own margin |
| **Margin**        | Your own capital used as collateral        |
| **Position Size** | Margin × Leverage                          |
| **P/L**           | Profit or Loss in absolute terms           |
| **ROI**           | Return on your own capital (P/L ÷ Margin)  |

### **2️⃣ Core Formula (applies to both long & short)**

[
\text{P/L} = \text{Position Size} \times \left(\frac{\text{Exit Price} - \text{Entry Price}}{\text{Entry Price}}\right)
]

Then add **sign** depending on trade direction:

* **Long:** Positive if Exit > Entry
* **Short:** Positive if Exit < Entry

You can combine both in one formula:

[
\text{P/L} = \text{Margin} \times \text{Leverage} \times \text{Direction} \times \left(\frac{\text{Exit Price} - \text{Entry Price}}{\text{Entry Price}}\right)
]

Where
**Direction = +1** for long, **–1** for short.

---

### **3️⃣ Example A – Long Trade (10× Leverage)**

* Margin = **$1,000**
* Leverage = **10×**
* Position Size = $10,000
* Entry = $50,000
* Exit = $51,000 (+2%)

[
\text{P/L} = 1000 × 10 × (51,000 - 50,000)/50,000 = 1000 × 10 × 0.02 = $200
]

**Result:** +$200 profit → +20% ROI

---

### **4️⃣ Example B – Short Trade (10× Leverage)**

Now you **sell first**, expecting price to drop.

* Margin = **$1,000**
* Leverage = **10×**
* Position Size = $10,000
* Entry = $50,000
* Exit = $49,000 (–2%)

[
\text{P/L} = 1000 × 10 × (-1) × \frac{49,000 - 50,000}{50,000}
]

[
\text{P/L} = 1000 × 10 × (-1) × (-0.02) = +$200
]

**Result:** +$200 profit → +20% ROI

✅ Because price fell, the short position gains value.

---

### **5️⃣ If Price Moves Against You**

If BTC rises from **$50,000 → $51,000** while you are **short**:

[
\text{P/L} = 1000 × 10 × (-1) × (51,000 - 50,000)/50,000 = -$200
]

**Result:** –$200 loss → –20% ROI.

---

### **6️⃣ Include Fees and Funding**

Leverage also amplifies how much small fees affect your returns.
Usually, two main types of costs:

#### **a) Trading Fees**

Exchange charges when you open & close:
[
\text{Trading Fee} = \text{Position Size} × \text{Fee Rate}
]
Example: 0.05% per side
→ $10,000 × 0.0005 × 2 = $10 total.

Subtract that from P/L.

---

#### **b) Funding Rate (for perpetual futures)**

If you hold positions overnight, you may **pay or receive** funding (depends on market imbalance).

[
\text{Funding P/L} = \text{Position Size} × \text{Funding Rate}
]

Example:
Funding rate = 0.01%
→ $10,000 × 0.0001 = $1 every funding interval.

Add/subtract accordingly.

---

### **7️⃣ Final Formula (Full Version)**

[
\text{Net P/L} = (\text{Margin} × \text{Leverage} × \text{Direction} × \frac{\text{Exit} - \text{Entry}}{\text{Entry}}) - \text{Trading Fees} ± \text{Funding}
]

---

### **8️⃣ Liquidation Warning**

If your losses approach your margin value, position gets **liquidated**.

Roughly:
[
\text{Liquidation Price (Long)} ≈ \text{Entry Price} × \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{Leverage}}\right)
]

[
\text{Liquidation Price (Short)} ≈ \text{Entry Price} × \left(1 + \frac{1}{\text{Leverage}}\right)
]

So with 10× leverage, a **10% move against you** wipes out your margin.

### **9️⃣ Summary Table**

| Type      | Entry  | Exit   | Market Move | Leverage | Margin | P/L   | ROI  |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| **Long**  | 50,000 | 51,000 | +2%         | 10×      | $1,000 | +$200 | +20% |
| **Long**  | 50,000 | 49,000 | –2%         | 10×      | $1,000 | –$200 | –20% |
| **Short** | 50,000 | 49,000 | –2%         | 10×      | $1,000 | +$200 | +20% |
| **Short** | 50,000 | 51,000 | +2%         | 10×      | $1,000 | –$200 | –20% |
